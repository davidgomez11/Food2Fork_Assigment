# Food2Fork_Assigment
Displays ingredients from a recipe and so forth

## **Extra Notes**
Make sure you are able to import the `urllib`, `requests`, `sys`, and `json` libraries.
You can run the main file by just compiling and running. As of now this script displays 
ingredients you may have, as well as the missing ingredients from the recipe that is 
returned.
Make sure you put in ingredients in the format of either "1 egg" or "eggs", as long as the numeric amount is in front of the ingredient.
There are also 2 runner functions in the sense that one of them takes in ingredients from the command line, and the other one takes in ingredients from `argv`, but the one that runs automatically is the one that takes in ingredients from the command line in a step by step fashion.
